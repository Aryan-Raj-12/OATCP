# Algorithm -

- Calculating initial values: The algorithm starts by calculating two important values, sum and F0. sum is the sum of all elements in the input array arr, while F0 is the initial value for the function F at rotation 0. F0 is calculated by summing up the product of each element of the array arr with its index i.

- Dynamic programming array initialization: The algorithm initializes a dynamic programming array dp of size equal to the number of elements in the input array arr. dp[i] represents the maximum value of the function F achievable after rotating the array by i positions.

- Updating dynamic programming array: The algorithm iterates over the elements of the input array arr and updates the dp array using dynamic programming. At each iteration, it calculates the value of dp[i] based on the previous value dp[i - 1] and the sum of elements in the array. It essentially simulates the rotation of the array and calculates the corresponding value of F for each rotation.

- Finding the maximum value: While updating the dp array, the algorithm keeps track of the maximum value encountered in the ans variable. This maximum value represents the maximum value of the function F achievable after any rotation of the array.

- Returning the result: Finally, the algorithm returns the maximum value of the function F modulo MOD, which is stored in the variable ans. This represents the maximum value of the function achievable after rotating the array arr by any number of positions.
