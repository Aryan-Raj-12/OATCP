# Algorithm -

- Initialization: The algorithm starts by initializing some variables. maxi is initialized to INT_MIN, which is the smallest possible integer value, ensuring that any valid product will be greater than this value. x is initialized to 0, and product is initialized to 1. These variables are used to keep track of the maximum product encountered, the last negative product encountered, and the current product of consecutive numbers respectively.

- Iterating through the array: The algorithm then iterates through the input array nums. At each iteration, it updates the product by multiplying it with the current element of the array. It also updates maxi to store the maximum of maxi and product.

- Handling zero products: If the current product becomes 0, it means that the previous sequence of numbers encountered has a zero product. In this case, the product is reset to 1, and x is also reset to 0. This is done to start afresh for the next sequence.

- Handling negative products: If the current product is negative, it could potentially contribute to a maximum product if combined with the previous negative product. If x is 0, it means that no negative product has been encountered before this point, so x is updated to the current product. If x is non-zero, it means a negative product has been encountered before, so the algorithm updates maxi to store the maximum of maxi and the current product divided by x. This is done because multiplying by a negative number could make the product positive and potentially contribute to a larger product.

- Returning the result: Finally, the algorithm returns maxi, which holds the maximum product of any contiguous subarray of the input array nums, modulo MOD.
